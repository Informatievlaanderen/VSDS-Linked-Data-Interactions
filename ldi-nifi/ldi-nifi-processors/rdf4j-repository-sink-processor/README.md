# RDF4J repository sink processor
## About
An Apache NiFi processor that materialises an LDES stream into a triplestore.
Any triplestore that supports the RDF4J remote repository API can be used.

## Install
Either copy the NAR file to the NiFi extentions folder or bind-mount the 'nifi-extentions' folder in docker-compose.yml.

## Configuration
Add the processor to the NiFi workflow and configure it. The processor offers 2 parameters:

 - Predicate used for isVersionOf: The predicate that the LDES stream consumed by the client uses to indicate the version property (ldes:versionOfPath).
 - Restrict output to members: If set to true, statements about entities that are not part of the LDES member will be removed from the stream. In case of doubt leave this disabled.

## Testing
To test the processor locally, run an RDF4J docker image and configure the NiFi workflow with the correct parameters.

For instance:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1g -Xmx4g" \
  -v data:/var/rdf4j \
  -v logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs eclipse/rdf4j-workbench:4.2.2
```

Processor configuration for the above example:

`SPARQL_HOST: http://localhost:8080/rdf4j-server`

`REPOSITORY_ID: test`
