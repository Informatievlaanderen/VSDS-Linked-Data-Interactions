# SPARQL Construct Transformer

The SPARQL Construct Transformer will modify the model based on the given [SPARQL] Construct Query.

SPARQL Construct is a query language used in semantic Web technologies to create RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs from existing RDF data. It allows users to specify a pattern of data they wish to extract from the RDF data and construct a new graph based on that pattern.

The SPARQL Construct query language provides a powerful way to create new RDF data by using existing data as the input. It can be used to transform RDF data into different formats, as well as to simplify the structure of RDF data by aggregating or filtering data.

This SPARQL Construct Transfomer building block can be used to execute model transformations.
