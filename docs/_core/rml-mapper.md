# RML Adapter

The RML Adapter allows a user to transform a non-LD object (json/CSV/XML) to an RDF object.

This is done by providing a [RML] mapping file.
However, as RML is written in RDF, it can be challenging for a new user to create a new mapping.

That's where [YARRRML] comes into play. Along with the online editor [Matey], it's easy to build one's own mapping and then export it into RML.
